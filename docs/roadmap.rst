Roadmap
=======

We aim for improvements to ``respy`` in three domains: Economics, Software Engineering,
and Numerical Methods.

Economics
---------

* support the full model of Keane and Wolpin (1997)

Software Engineering
--------------------

* research the *hypothesis* package to replace the hand-crafted property-based testing
  routines

Numerical Methods
-----------------

* link the package to optimization toolkits such as *TAO* or *HOPSPACK*
* implement additional integration strategies following Skrainka and Judd (2011)
